    "text": "Goals and Objectives\nFor our research project, we have selected datasets of hourly observations of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang, along with other meteorological data for each city,from 1-1-2013 to 12-31-2015. These datasets were retrieved from the PM2.5 Data of Five Chinese Cities Data Set from UCI machine learning repository, and converted from a singular RAR file to CSV files online.\nOur project question is: #### “Given the sample data for cities in China, is there a significant decrease in PM2.5 concentration in the cities in China between 2013 and 2015?”\nGiven the project question, let \\(\\mu_{2013}\\) and \\(\\mu_{2015}\\) be the mean PM2.5 concentration in 2013 and 2015 respectively for each location, and let \\(\\sigma_{2013}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{2015}\\) be the standard deviation of the PM2.5 concentration in 2013 and 2015 respectively for each location, with all values measured in \\(g/m^3\\). The following hypothesis tests will be conducted:\nHypothesis test 1: - \\(H_0: \\mu_{2013} = \\mu_{2015}\\) - \\(H_1: \\mu_{2013} &gt; \\mu_{2015}\\)\nHypothesis test 2: - \\(H_0: \\sigma_{2013} = \\sigma_{2015}\\) - \\(H_1: \\sigma_{2013} \\neq \\sigma_{2015}\\)\nThe differences in standard deviation for each location are tested to inform us of whether or not comparing the differences in means for each location is a reliable method for our investigation. For instance, if there is a significant difference in both the mean and standard deviation of PM2.5 concentrations, then the comparison of PM2.5 concentrations may be difficult due to differing distributions of data.",

    "text": "Results\nWe conducted 2 hypothesis tests that were meant to give us a greater context for our analysis. As stated in the introduction, the differences in standard deviation for each location are tested to inform us of whether comparing the differences in means for each location would be a reliable method for our investigation.\nFor hypothesis test 1, \\(H_0\\) claims that mean PM2.5 concentrations between 2013 and 2015 are the same. From section 3.3, we reject \\(H_0\\) for Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, as they all have extremely small p-values (&lt; 0.05), and fail to reject it in Beijing and Shenyang. The differences in means shown by the 3 locations where we reject the \\(H_0\\) are significant as exposure to as little as 35\\(\\mu g /m^{3}\\) may cause serious health issues for people. (Devadmin, 2021)\nThus, \\(H_0\\) is rejected in 3 out of 5 cities, suggesting that in hypothesis test 1, our data favours \\(H_1\\), that the PM2.5 concentration in 2013 is greater than in 2015. This goes hand in hand with our expectations. As explained in the ‘Methods and Results’ section, we would consider the policy effective if we encountered a substantial improvement in the air quality of at least three out of the five cities in our study.\nTo ensure our results are reliable, we still need to review our results for hypothesis test 2, where \\(H_0: \\sigma_{2013} = \\sigma_{2015}\\). From section 3.4, we reject \\(H_0\\) in all 5 cities, due to their extremely small p-values (&lt; 0.05). Thus, our data favours \\(H_1\\), that the PM2.5 concentration standard deviation between 2013 and 2015 are not equal, indicating that our tests may not be completely reliable. This is, however, beyond the scope of this project, and further and more in-depth analysis would be required to confirm such.\nWe found that there was a significant difference in levels of PM2.5 concentration in Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai from 2013 to 2015. External research suggests that there are many factors that point to why the levels of PM2.5 concentration decreased, such as government policies targeted at shutting down high-pollution factories and power plants, as well as technological advancements in pollution control.",

The data can be used by policymakers to find areas that need more focus (such as Beijing and Shenyang) and to create policies that are more suited to the unique conditions of each location. The results may also aid in researchers’ understanding of the variables influencing PM2.5 concentrations in various geographic areas.\nThis project could lead to extremely relevant future questions, such as: - What are the long-term health effects of PM2.5 pollution on vulnerable populations, and how can policymakers mitigate these effects? - How can we ensure that the policy remains effective? - What are the most effective strategies for reducing pollution and addressing climate change, and how can policymakers encourage widespread adoption of these strategies? - How can the policy analysed in this paper be replicated in other countries?",
